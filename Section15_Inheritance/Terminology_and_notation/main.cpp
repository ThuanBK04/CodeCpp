- Derived class (child class, sub class)
+ The class being created from base class
+ Will inherit attributes and operations from base class

- "Is-A" relationship
+ public inheritance
+ Derived classes are sub-types of their base classes
+ Can use a derived class object wherever we use a base class object
- Generalization
+ Combining similar classes into a single, more general class based on common attributes
- Specialization
