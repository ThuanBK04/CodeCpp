/*

- Virtual Destructors
+ Problems can happen when we destroy polymorphic objects
+ If a derived class is destroyed by deleting its storage via the base class pointer and the class
a non-virtual destructor. Then the behavior is undefined in the C++ standard
Explain: all the compiler knows is that we've got pointers to account objects, so it really
doesn't know which destructor to call, this is undefined in the C++ standard
+ Derived objects must be destroyed in the correct order starting at the correct destructor

- Solution/Rule
+ If a class has virtual functions
+ Always provide a public virtual destructor
+ If base class destructor is virtual then all derived class destructors are also virtual
Ex:
class Account
{
public:
	virtual void withdraw (double amount);
	virtual ~Account();
	....
}
